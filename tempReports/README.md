# RDF Model Output Explorer
This generates a dashboard to view, analyze, and query data from RiverWare *.rdf model 
outputs. This is primarily meant to support U.S. Bureau of Reclamation modeling and 
analysis efforts with the 24-Month Study, Mid-Term Operations Model and Colorado River 
Simulation System models. Although the stated purpose is to support USBR, the tool will 
be developed to be as generic as possible so as to enable other users to use is so long 
as a RiverWare *.rdf file is provided.

The dashboard is being developed in [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/) and requires the installation of the following R libraries:
<BR>[shiny](http://shiny.rstudio.com/)
<BR>[shinydashboard](https://rstudio.github.io/shinydashboard/index.html)
<BR>[shinyTree](https://github.com/trestletech/shinyTree)
<BR>[DT](https://rstudio.github.io/DT/)
<BR>[xts](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/xts/index.html)
<BR>[zoo](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/zoo/index.html)
