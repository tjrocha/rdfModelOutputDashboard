# This application was built in RStudio by Jon Rocha at jrocha@usbr.gov
#
# The application allows users to query, subset, view, and plot RiverWare RDF model outputs. 
# This is primarily meant to support U.S. Bureau of Reclamation (USBR) modeling and analysis 
# efforts with the 24-Month Study, Mid-Term Operations Model, and Colorado River Simulation 
# System models. Although the stated purpose is to support USBR, the tool is being developed 
# to be as generic as possible so as to enable other users to use it so long as a RiverWare 
# *.rdf file is provided.
